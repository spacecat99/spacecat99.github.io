        <h1>Project overview</h1>
          <p2> Thai Thai is my imagianry modern Thai Restaurant. Because there are already so many other busines, is important to have a easy but also atractive website and smart fitures to tempt new clients and keep old costumers satisfy. It also needs a tool that helps people ordere the food from home. They could choose between home delyverys, pickup or to preorder and eat on the location.
          This options target mostly people that are very busy working or studying and would proorder the food to be delyverd or prepared whenn they get there so that dinning doesn't thake too much  time away and they can focus on more important things.
          </p2>

          <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p2> Between March and May 2020, when lockdowns in Europe and the United States were the most severe, the food-delivery market spiked. A little under two decades ago, restaurant-quality meal delivery was still largely limited to foods such as pizza and Chinese. Nowadays, food delivery has become a global market worth more than $150 billion, having more than tripled since 2017.
            <br> Increasing sales through delivery may look like a smart way to cower fixed costs, but restaurants that focus too much on increasing deliveries could kill their in-house dining and compromise the quality of the dining experience, which could eventually reduce the base over which their fixed costs are spread.
            </p2>

        <h2>The Goal</h2>
          <p2> Focosing to providing services to push in-house dining and delivery and to keep them in balance.
          </p2>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p2>Single UX designer leading the app and responsive website design from conception to delivery
            Conducting interviews (family members and friends), paper and digital wireframing, low and high-fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies (family members and friends), iterating on designs, determining information architecture, and responsive design.
          </p2>

        <h1>Understanding the User</h1>
          <h2> User research</h2>
            <p2> I made some research on modern eating habits to develop interview questions, which were then used to conduct user interviews. The feedback received through research made it very clear that users would prefer online ordering directly on the first hand website of the restaurant they want to order from and not from third party website like UberEats or Doordasch. Most interview participants also added that they feel ordering food is in general too expensive, so they don't do it so often.
            </p2>

          <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p2> I did a quick ideation exercise to come up with ideas for how to address gaps identified in the competitive audit. My focus was specifically on preorder options and ordering userflows.

        <h1>Starting the Design</h1>
            <h2>Digital Wireframes</h2>
            <p2> After ideating and drafting some paper wireframes, I created the initial designs for the Thai Thai Webpage. These designs focused on delivering personalized guidance to users to help manage their food.</p2>
          <h2>Low-fidelity prototype</h2>
            <p2> To prepare for usability testing, I created a low-fidelity prototype that connected the user flow of viewing an item about to expire and using it in a recipe.
