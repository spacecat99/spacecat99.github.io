            <h1>Project overview</h1>
              <p2> Decoore is my imaginary modern interior design label that tries to present itself with a simple mobile website. 
                The aim was to match the style of the furniture the company makes with the mood and message of its website. 
                So I've tried to make it as clean, modern, yet as cozy and welcoming as possible. The user should be interested 
                after the first look and want to explore more. The target group is basically all people who are currently 
                looking for new furniture and want to upgrade their home.
              </p2>

              <div class="heropic2">

              <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p2> Many other companies that offer cheaper furniture and have a larger selection and styles dominate the market.
                  However, the products are also of inferior quality according to the price. The interior designers at Decoore put 
                  a lot of work, clever solutions and the best materials into their products that will last forever. 
                  Thus, are Decoore's actual competition only interior design companies with high quality.



            <h2>The Goal</h2>
              <p2>Creating an online environment that welcomes everyone. Customers shouldn't be put off by immediately thinking 
                they can't afford or don't want to spend a lot of money on a product and then click away. 
                The aim of the design is to invite users to at least look around and see what Decoore offers.
              </p2>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
              <p2>Single UX designer leading the app and responsive website design from conception to delivery
                Conducting interviews (family members and friends), paper and digital wireframing, low and high-fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies (family members and friends), iterating on designs, determining information architecture, and responsive design.

            <h1>Understanding the User</h1>
              <h2> User research</h2>
                <p2> 
                
                </p2>

              <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p2> I did a quick ideation exercise to come up with ideas for how to address gaps identified in the competitive audit. My focus was specifically on preorder options and ordering userflows.

        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Starting the Design</h1>
                <h2>Digital Wireframes</h2>
                <p2> After imagining and designing some wireframes on paper, I created the initial designs for the Decoore mobil website. These designs focused on easy layout. 
                  Not a lot or not too heavy text and leaving a lot of space for images.

                </div>



              <h2>Low-fidelity prototype</h2>
                <p2> To prepare for usability testing, I created a low-fidelity prototype that connected the user flow of viewing an item about to expire and using it in a recipe.

            <h1>Refining the Design</h1>
              <h2>Mockups</h2>
                <p2>  Based on the insights from the usability studies, I applied design changes like providing a clear section from the home screen to browse recipes that specifically use items available in “My Food”. </p2>

                <p2>Additional design changes included adding an option to “Add new item” to the “My Food” page, and providing a clearer indication of how many days were left before an item expired.</p>

              <h2>High-fidelity prototype</h2>
                <p2> The high-fidelity prototype followed the same user flow as the low-fidelity prototype, including design changes made after the usability study.View the Food Saver high-fidelity prototype </p2>

            <h1>Going Forward</h1>
              <p2> In conclusion, I think the mobile webpage came up pretty elegant and interesting enough to 
                invite users to see what the company is offering. 
                It's true that I haven't finished the order flow yet, 
                so the project isn't finished yet completely.  </p2>
