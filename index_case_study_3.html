            <h1>Project overview</h1>
              <p2>
                              
                My good friend is starting her own small business, so i offered to help with her online campaign. This 
                project was different from the others, because for these designs i had an actual
                costumer that gave some guidelines to follow. And after first suggestions, i immediately got an honest 
                feedback from her and concrete wishes that had to be incorporated into end product. So i didn't go through 
                the usability studies as per usual, because the only person checking the progress was the client herself.
              </p2>

                            
            <h2>The Goal</h2>
              <p2>
                Her wish was a simple one site Webpage with basic animation and not a lot of interaction. 
                She wanted to go sure that the site is wellcoming for users of all different ages. costumers have to be able to get the most 
                important information as fast as they can. The information has to be clear, not hidden in long texts. also 
                not overshodowed by any other element of teh site, such as unrelated pictures and animations. The color 
                palete and the design should be appeling and conforting to the eye but also awake an interest. 
              </p2>
