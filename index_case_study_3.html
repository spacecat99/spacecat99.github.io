            <h1>Project overview</h1>
              <p2>
                              
                My good friend is starting her own small business, so i offered to help with her online campaign. This 
                project was different from the others, because for these designs i had an actual
                costumer that gave some guidelines to follow. And after first suggestions, i immediately got an honest 
                feedback from her and concrete wishes that had to be incorporated into end product. So i didn't go through 
                the usability studies as per usual, because the only person checking the progress was the client herself.

              <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p2> Many other companies that offer cheaper furniture and have a larger selection and styles dominate the market.
                  However, the products are also of inferior quality according to the price. The interior designers at Decoore put 
                  a lot of work, clever solutions and the best materials into their products that will last forever. 
                  Thus, are Decoore's actual competition only interior design companies with high quality.



            <h2>The Goal</h2>
              <p2>
                Her wish was a simple one site Webpage with basic animation and not a lot of interaction. 
                She wanted to go sure that the site is wellcoming for users of all different ages. costumers have to be able to get the most 
                important information as fast as they can. The information has to be clear, not hidden in long texts. also 
                not overshodowed by any other element of teh site, such as unrelated pictures and animations. The color 
                palete and the design should be appeling and conforting to the eye but also awake an interest. 
              </p2>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
              <p2>Single UX designer leading the app and responsive website design from conception to delivery
                Conducting interviews (family members and friends), paper and digital wireframing, low and high-fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies (family members and friends), iterating on designs, determining information architecture, and responsive design.

            <h1>Understanding the User</h1>
              <h2> User research</h2>
                <p2> 
                
                </p2>

              <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p2> I did a quick ideation exercise to come up with ideas for how to address gaps identified in the competitive audit. My focus was specifically on preorder options and ordering userflows.

            <h1>Starting the Design</h1>
                <h2>Digital Wireframes</h2>
                <p2> After imagining and designing some wireframes on paper, I created the initial designs for the Decoore mobil website. These designs focused on easy layout. 
                  Not a lot or not too heavy text and leaving a lot of space for images.

              <h2>Low-fidelity prototype</h2>
                <p2> To prepare for usability testing, I created a low-fidelity prototype that connected the user flow of viewing an item about to expire and using it in a recipe.

            <h1>Refining the Design</h1>
              <h2>Mockups</h2>
                <p2>  Based on the insights from the usability studies, I applied design changes like providing a clear section from the home screen to browse recipes that specifically use items available in “My Food”. </p2>

                <p2>Additional design changes included adding an option to “Add new item” to the “My Food” page, and providing a clearer indication of how many days were left before an item expired.</p>

              <h2>High-fidelity prototype</h2>
                <p2> The high-fidelity prototype followed the same user flow as the low-fidelity prototype, including design changes made after the usability study.View the Food Saver high-fidelity prototype </p2>
